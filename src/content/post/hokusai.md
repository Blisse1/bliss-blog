> Ever since I was six, I have been obsessed with drawing the shapes of things. By the time I was fifty, I had published countless drawings, but nothing I produced before the age of seventy is worthy of note. Not until I was seventy-three did I begin to understand the structure of nature as it truly is, the structure of animals, plants, trees, birds, fish and insects. Thus, by the time I am eighty, I will have made some real progress. At ninety I will have fathomed the mystery of things; at a hundred I will surely have reached a phenomenal level, and when I’m a hundred and ten, everything I do, be it a dot or a line, will be alive. I would ask anyone living as long as I do to see if I am true to my word. Written at the age of seventy-five, by me, formerly called Gakyō Rojin, the old madman of art.
>> Hokusai

"Never stop learning. Never treat yourself as “you have arrived.” Never think it’s too late to learn or start anew. Every step is a beginning. Mastery is in the simplest of things."
